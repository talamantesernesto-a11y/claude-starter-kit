# Root Cause Tracing

## Overview

Bugs often manifest deep in the call stack. Your instinct is to fix where the error appears, but that's treating a symptom.

**Core principle:** Trace backward through the call chain until you find the original trigger, then fix at the source.

## The Tracing Process

### 1. Observe the Symptom
```
Error: git init failed in /Users/jesse/project/packages/core
```

### 2. Find Immediate Cause
```typescript
await execFileAsync('git', ['init'], { cwd: projectDir });
```

### 3. Ask: What Called This?
```typescript
WorktreeManager.createSessionWorktree(projectDir, sessionId)
  -> called by Session.initializeWorkspace()
  -> called by Session.create()
  -> called by test at Project.create()
```

### 4. Keep Tracing Up
- `projectDir = ''` (empty string!)
- Empty string as `cwd` resolves to `process.cwd()`

### 5. Find Original Trigger
```typescript
const context = setupCoreTest(); // Returns { tempDir: '' }
Project.create('name', context.tempDir); // Accessed before beforeEach!
```

## Adding Stack Traces

When you can't trace manually:

```typescript
async function gitInit(directory: string) {
  const stack = new Error().stack;
  console.error('DEBUG git init:', { directory, cwd: process.cwd(), stack });
  await execFileAsync('git', ['init'], { cwd: directory });
}
```

**Critical:** Use `console.error()` in tests (not logger - may not show)

## Key Principle

**NEVER fix just where the error appears.** Trace back to find the original trigger.
